    "### ✅ **1. Make sure you're on the right branch**\n",
    "\n",
    "Check your current branch:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git branch\n",
    "```\n",
    "If you're not on the branch you want to commit to (e.g., `feature/login`), switch to it:\n",

    "git checkout feature/login\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git add .\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "git add Application/login.js\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ **4. Commit your changes**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now create a commit with a descriptive message:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git commit -m \"Add login page functionality\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This commit is now part of the **current branch only** — it does *not* affect `main` or any other branches.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔄 **(Optional) 5. Push to remote branch (e.g., GitHub)**\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git push origin feature/login\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If it's the first time pushing this branch:\n",
